## 📘 **Exercises**  

### 📚 **Exercise 1 – Library Book Management**  
**Implement a class to manage a book collection in a library.**  

#### **Features:**  
- Add books to the collection  
- Retrieve the full list of books  
- Get a book by its position  
- Insert a book at a specific position  
- Remove a book by title  

#### **JUnit Tests to Implement:**  
✔ Verify the book list is not `null` after initialization  
✔ Confirm the correct size after inserting books  
✔ Ensure books are in the right positions  
✔ Check for no duplicate titles  
✔ Validate book retrieval by position  
✔ Test that adding a book modifies the list correctly  
✔ Verify that removing a book reduces the list size  
✔ Ensure alphabetical order after modifications

### 🔢 **Exercise 2 – DNI Letter Calculation**  
**Implement a class that calculates the DNI letter based on the number.**  

#### **JUnit Tests to Implement:**  
✔ **Parameterized test** with 10 predefined DNI numbers  
✔ Validate correct letter calculation for each case  

---

### ⚠️ **Exercise 3 – Exception Handling**  
**Create a class with a method that throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.**  

#### **JUnit Tests to Implement:**  
✔ Verify that the method throws the expected exception
